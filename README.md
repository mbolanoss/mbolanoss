I am a recent systems engineering graduate passionate about technology and the advantages we can get from it. I have practical experience in both software development and cybersecurity, and in the latter, I see myself as part of the Blue Team.

## Objective

My engineering background has led me to develop an early interest in software development as that was my focus at the beginning of my college career, but as I neared completion, I became passionate about cybersecurity, and am now looking forward to transitioning into this field, specifically with the goal of joining a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 analyst.
